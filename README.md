# 3D 2048
Based on [Gabriele Cirulli's 2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/).

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://baiqiang.github.io/2048-3d/)

## Changes from regular game

* 3D 3x3x3 grid
* Special tiles

### Special tiles

There are 3 'bonus' tiles, '4', '64' and '256'. They have different colors from normal tiles and can only be merged with same one. Both tiles will disappear after being merged.

It's not a really bonus tile. I added them just to increase difficulty. Since the 3d version has more tiles and more directions, it's much easier than the normal version if there's no traverse. Do you have any good idea?

## How to play

Use your arrow keys to move the tiles, R(or Q) and F(or E) to move ahead and back, any useless letter key to rotate, hold 1, 2 or 3 to hide layers, ESC and 0 to restart. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one!.
